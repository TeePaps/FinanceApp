Stage all changes, commit with a descriptive message based on the changes, and push to remote. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to see what changed
2. Create a concise commit message summarizing the changes
3. Run `git add -A && git commit` with the message
4. Run `git push`

Use the standard commit message format with the Claude Code signature.
