## Original Request

The "Investment Recommendations" seems to only be showing S&P 500. I want to make sure the recommendation engine calculations are working properly, and it updates on any update operation.

## Key Concerns

1. Investment Recommendations may be limited to S&P 500 only
2. Recommendation engine calculations need verification
3. Recommendations should update on any update operation
