# Initial Request

## User Request
Fix data showing in "All Tracked Stocks" on Data Sets page. It shows updated 2m ago but doesn't show anything except the price. Should show the other fields as well but all are -

## Context
- The Data Sets page has an "All Tracked Stocks" section
- The data appears to be updating (shows "updated 2m ago")
- Only the price field is populated
- Other fields (EPS, dividend, fair value, etc.) are showing as "-" (empty/null)

## Expected Behavior
All data fields should display their values, not just the price.
